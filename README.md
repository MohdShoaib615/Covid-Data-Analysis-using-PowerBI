# Covid-Data-Analysis-using-PowerBI

In this repository, we have done the Covid data Analysis using PowerBI dashboard.
First, scrape the covid data from the WHO website, using python. Get the scraped data into CSV/Excel format and then upload this 
file into PowerBI.
Using appropriate charts, we have shown different visualizations on how the deaths, cases, vaccine dose differ from country to country.

WE HAVE ANALYZED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS:-
1- Most no of new cases are coming from the USA.
2- Most no of deaths are also occuring in the USA.
3- The reason might be that - USA has least no of fully vaccinated persons.
